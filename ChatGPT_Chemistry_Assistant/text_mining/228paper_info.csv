Subsequently, it was observed that 2-propanol can be readily replaced by equal volumes of water, water/2-propanol, and water/ethanol mixtures, respectively. While Zr-CAU-28 is always obtained (Figure 2), this affects the particle diameter as observed by dynamic light scattering (see Supporting Information, SI, Table S1 and Figures S1, S2). The optimized reaction system is ZrOCl2·8H2O/H2FDC/H2O/acetic acid. The most crystalline product is obtained by a microwave-assisted reaction of a mixture of 45 mg (0.28 mmol) of H2FDC, 60 mg (0.19 mmol) ZrOCl2·8H2O, 700 μL acetic acid, and 800 μL H2O. The reaction mixture was stirred for several minutes before being placed into the microwave oven at 80 °C for 1 h. The raw product was separated via centrifugation and washed in ethanol by redispersion and centrifugation. Yield: 55 mg (46% based on H2FDC) of a white crystalline powder of [Zr6O4(OH)4(FDC)4(OH)4(H2O)4]·nH2O with n ≈ 16 (elemental analysis measured: C: 16.71; H: 2.26; calculated: C: 16.72; H: 3.90).

Synthesis of Ce-CAU-28
2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (33.3 mg, 0.21 mmol) was introduced into a pyrex tube glass reactor. After the addition of 1.2 mL of DMF and formic acid (515 μL, 13.57 mmol), an aqueous 0.533 m solution of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (400 μL, 0.21 mmol) was added to the mixture. The glass reactor was sealed and heated under stirring for 15 min at 100 °C. The white precipitate was centrifuged in the mother liquor which was then decanted off before being redispersed and centrifuged twice in DMF (2 mL). To remove DMF from the product, the solid was subsequently washed and centrifuged with acetone (2 mL) four times. The resulting white solid was dried in air at 70 °C. Yield: 35 mg (29%).

High-throughput methods (2 mL teflon inserts) were employed in the screening of
synthesis parameters such as molar ratio of metal to linker, pH and reaction temperature.
The usage of molar linker to metal ratios of 1 : 1 resulted in CAU-29 with low
crystallinity, while higher ratios up to a five times excess of metal (1 : 1 in the structure)
and the 3-fold concentration of the reactants led to highly crystalline CAU-29 (Fig. S5).
Furthermore an upscaling in 30 mL teflon inserts of CAU-29 was possible using the 12
fold amount of all reactants. In the following the optimized and upscaled synthesis

74,74MIL100,10.1002/anie.200600105,"Synthesis 
Concerning MIL-100, due to the presence of significant 
amount of metallic chromium during the synthesis conditions 
reported previously,[1] another synthetic route involving 
chromium(VI) oxide was developed. To 0.5 g of chromium (VI) 
oxide CrO3, 1,05 g of trimesic acid, 1.0 ml of a 5 M 
hydrofluorohydric solution and 24 ml of de-ionized water were 
added and stirred a few minutes at room temperature. The 
slurry was then introduced in a Teflon-line Paar hydrothermal 
bomb and set four days at 220°C. The resulting green solid was 
washed with de-ionized water and acetone and dried at room 
temperature under air atmosphere. 
MIL-101a corresponds to the as-synthesised form of MIL101, obtained hydrothermally (220°C for 8 h) as reported 
before.[2] The crystalline MIL-101b product was first 
hydrothermally synthesized at 220°C for 9 h but the autoclave 
reactor after synthesis was slowly cooled down to room 
temperature for 3 h in order to obtain larger crystals of the 
unreacted terephthalic acid. Then the crystalline MIL-101b 
product in the solution was doubly filtered off using two 
filters (glass and paper filters) with a pore size between 40 
and 100 µm to remove the free acid. A solvothermal treatment 
of the product was sequentially performed using ethanol (95 % 
EtOH, 5% water) in an ultrasonic vessel at elevated
temperature for 2-3 h. The resulting solid was cooled down, 
filtered and washed with the solvent. The solid was finally 
dried overnight at 150°C under air atmosphere. After then, a 
hydrothermal of the product was performed using boiling water 
in a round bottom flask at 85°C for 3 h. The resulting solid 
was repeatedly cooled down, filtered and washed with the

76,76MOF177,10.1021/ja512311a,"""General Preparation and Activation of MOF Materials
To minimize the number of factors (including concentration, solvent, temperature, and time of reaction) that can affect the formation of the qom topology, syntheses of the isoreticular MOF-177-X and MTV-MOF-177 compounds were carried out under similar reaction conditions as those employed for MOF-177-A (i.e., parent MOF-177). In general, these MOFs were prepared by solvothermal reaction of a mixture containing the appropriate BTB linker(s), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and DEF. However, to improve the quality of crystals, concentration of starting materials, solvent, reaction temperature, and/or reaction time were slightly modified as required. The resulting crystalline products were isolated by decanting the mother liquor and were subsequently washed with fresh solvent.
Removal of guest molecules within the MOF materials’ pores began with a solvent exchange procedure that included immersing the as-synthesized samples into anhydrous DMF (typically 10 mL) and refreshing the DMF three times over the course of 3 days. Further solvent exchange, but this time with low boiling point solvents, was carried out in a similar fashion (three times over the course of 3 days). For typical activation, (11) a MOF sample was fully exchanged with chloroform or dichloromethane (10 mL) and evacuated at room temperature for 6 h and at 100 °C for an additional 18 h. For supercritical CO2 drying (SCD) activation, (12) a MOF sample was fully immersed in anhydrous acetone and thoroughly exchanged with liquid CO2 in the chamber of a Tousimis Samdri PVT-3D critical point dryer. The sample was subsequently kept in a supercritical CO2 atmosphere (typical conditions of 35 °C and 1200 psi) for 30 min and then the supercritical CO2 was slowly vented at room temperature over the course of several hours.
MOF-177-A, Zn4O(BTB)2

Yellow block-shaped crystals were isolated and washed with DEF (3 × 5 mL). To yield guest-free material, the as-synthesized washed sample was fully exchanged with anhydrous DMF (3 × 10 mL for 3 days), followed with anhydrous acetone (3 × 10 mL for 3 days), and finally activated by the SCD method.

Synthesis of IRMOF-74-V-hex 
80.0 mg of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.313 mmol) and 65 mg of V-hex (0.089 mmol) were dissolved 
with 7.5 mL DMF in a 20 mL vial. The vial was sealed and sonicated for 20 min. To this 
solution, 0.5 mL of ethanol followed by 0.5 mL of deionized water was added drop wise. The

This solution was heated in an isothermal oven at 120 °C and allowed to react solvothermally for 
24 h yielding colorless needle crystals (60% yield based on organic link). 

Synthesis of IRMOF-74-VI 
IRMOF-74-VI was synthesized using Zn instead of Mg. Although our intent was to utilize Mg 
for the synthesis of the entire series, the fact that we used Zn does not detract from our purpose 
of demonstrating the systematic expansion of the MOF-74 topology. Many attempts at 
synthesizing the Mg version were carried out, but the conditions were not optimized to the same 
degree as the Zn version. Therefore, we chose to simply present the Zn version of IRMOF-74-
VI. 120 mg of Zn(NO3)2·4H2O (0.403 mmol) and 79.0 mg of VI (0.114 mmol) were 
dissolved with 10 mL DMF in a 20 mL vial. The vial was sealed and sonicated for two hours to 
ensure maximum solubility of the linker, VI. This white, cloudy solution was heated in an 
isothermal oven at 100 °C and allowed to react solvothermally for 48 h yielding colorless needle 
crystals (72% yield based on organic link). 

Synthesis of IRMOF-74-VII 
96 mg of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.375 mmol) and 100 mg of link VII (0.107 mmol) were dissolved 
with 9.0 mL DMF in a 20 mL vial. The vial was sealed and sonicated for 30 minutes, then heat 
in 100 °C oven until the solid was completely dissolved (usually within 20 minutes). To this hot 
solution, 0.5 mL of ethanol followed by 0.5 mL of deionized water was added drop wise. The 
vial was then vigorously swirled and shortly sonicated (2 to 3 seconds, not longer) resulting in a 
clear, colorless solution. This solution was heated in an isothermal oven at 120 °C and allowed to 
react solvothermally for 24 h yielding colorless needle crystals (71% yield based on organic 
link). 

Synthesis of IRMOF-74-VII-oeg

dissolved with 9.0 mL DMF in a 20 mL vial. The vial was sealed and sonicated for 30 minutes 
until the solid was completely dissolved. To this solution, 0.6 mL of ethanol followed by 0.6 mL 
of deionized water was added drop wise. The vial was then vigorously swirled and shortly 
sonicated resulting in a clear, colorless solution. This solution was heated in an isothermal oven 
at 120 °C and allowed to react solvothermally for 24 h yielding colorless needle crystals (87% 
yield based on organic link). 

Synthesis of IRMOF-74-IX 
96 mg of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.375 mmol) and 122 mg of link IX (0.107 mmol) were dissolved 
with 9.0 mL DMF in a 20 mL vial. The vial was sealed and sonicated for 30 minutes, then heat 
in 120 °C oven until the solid was completely dissolved (usually 40 minutes). To this hot 
solution, 0.5 mL of ethanol followed by 0.5 mL of deionized water was added drop wise. The 
vial was then vigorously swirled and shortly sonicated (2 to 3 seconds, not longer) resulting in a 
clear, colorless solution. This solution was heated in an isothermal oven at 130 °C and allowed to 
react solvothermally for 24 h yielding colorless needle crystals (65% yield based on organic link). 

Synthesis of IRMOF-74-XI 
6.0 mg of anhydrous MgCl2 (0.063 mmol) and 11 mg of link XI (0.0074 mmol) were added into 
a Pyrex tube measuring o.d. × i.d. = 10 × 8 mm2
. The tube was evacuated to less than 10 mTorr 
and then back filled with nitrogen. This process was repeated three times before 3 mL of 
anhydrous DMF was injected. The solution was then sonicated for 30 min. in the Pyrex tube with 
the opening tightly capped by septa. The tube was flash frozen at 77 K (LN2 bath), evacuated to 
an internal pressure of 20 mTorr and flame sealed. Upon sealing the length of the tube was 
reduced to ca. 18 cm. This solution was heated in sand bath in an isothermal oven at 130 °C and 
allowed to react solvothermally for 24 h yielding colorless needle crystals (50% yield based on

room temperature, the supernatant was removed and the material was washed twice 
with fresh DMF. Subsequently the crystals were washed twice with acetone and 
soaked in acetone for additional 12 h. The crystals of NU-1101 were filtered, briefly 
dried on a filter paper and activated on a SmartVacPrep station (Micromeritics) under 
dynamic vacuum at 120 ˚C until an outgassing rate of ≤ 0.002 mm Hg min-1 was 
reached.
Synthesis of NU-1102
In an O2 and H2O free drybox, ZrCl4 (37.5 mg, 0.16 mmol) was weighed into a 4-
dram vial. The vial was removed from the glovebox and Por-PP (59 mg, 0.054 mmol) 
along with 4 mL DEF was added into the vial. The solution was sonicated until a 
green homogeneous slurry was obtained. Next, benzoic acid (675 mg, 5.5 mmol) was 
added into the slurry and sonicated until dissolved. Finally, the 4-dram vial was sealed 
and placed in an oven at 120 ˚C for 3 days. After three days, dark purple crystals were 
formed on the walls and bottom of the vials and the mother liquor was removed. The 
crystals were washed with 8 mL of DMF three times over the course of 24 h (once 
overnight) followed by 8 mL of acetone three times over the course of 24 h (once 
overnight). Prior to gas adsorption measurements the acetone was decanted, the 
crystals were dried in a vacuum oven at 100 ˚C for at least 2 h. Subsequently the 
samples were dried on a SmartVac Prep station (Micromeritics) under dynamic 
vacuum at 120 ˚C until an outgassing rate of ≤ 0.002 mm Hg min-1 was reached.
Synthesis of NU-1103
In an ambient condition, Py-PTP (25 mg, 0.023 mmol), benzoic acid (1 g, 8.92 mmol)
were added into a 6-dram vial. 20 mL of DMF is then added and the vial was 
sonicated to fully dissolve the reagents. Then, ZrOCl28H2O (10 mg, 0.03 mmol) was 
quickly weighed into the vial containing the reagents, and the vial was sonicated 
again until no solid can be found in the vial. The solution prepared was divided into 
two portions, which is achieved by transferring half of the solution into an empty 6-
dram vial by pipet. The 2 vials prepared were heated in a heating block on a hotplate, 
and the temperature of the heating block is set at 120˚C by using thermocouple. After 
24 hours, vials were taken out from the heating block, and the mother solution was 
removed by centrifuging (10 mins, 7000 rpm). The crystalline powder obtained was 
washed with DMF three times over the course of 24 h, and centrifugation is used to 
separate liquid from the solid every time. Solid collected from 3 vials were combined 
and transferred into an 8-dram vial in solvated form. 30 mL of DMF was then added 
and the vial was heated at 100˚C for 16 h. Using centrifugation, solution part was 
discarded and the solid was washed with DMF twice over 8 hours. Then, absolute

solvent for three times over three days. This sample was subjected to supercritical 
carbon dioxide drying reported in previous paper. Liquid CO2 was used to exchange 
the ethanol, the system was vented 4 times over the course of 10 hours to fully 
exchange the ethanol with CO2. The system was then bleeded at the rate of 0.2 cc/s.
Subsequently the samples were dried on an activation port of an ASAP 2020 under 
dynamic vacuum at 120 ˚C until an outgassing rate of ≤ 0.002 mm Hg min-1

and the vial was swirled gently and placed in an oven at 90˚C for 2 days to metallate 
the porphyrin core. After cooling down to room temperature the mother liquor was 
replaced with fresh DMF and the crystals were soaked in DMF overnight to remove 
unreacted salts. The material was then removed from DMF and soaked in absolute 
ethanol to exchange the solvent. Fresh ethanol was used for three times over three 
days to exchange DMF. The sample was then desolvated using the supercritical 
carbon dioxide method as described above. Finally the sample was outgassed on an 
activation port of an ASAP 2020 under dynamic vacuum at room temperature until an

Although we can obtain the single crystal of PCN-228, it’s failed to get the single crystal X-ray 
diffraction data because of the small crystal size. However, using the similar ligands H4TCP-1’ 
(Scheme 1), we can obtained very large single crystal PCN-228’ whose structure can be 
successfully determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The PXRD of PCN-228 is identical 
with the simulated PXRD of PCN-228’ indicating the isostructure of these two MOFs. The
structure and phase purity of PCN-228 thereby were determined.

104,104DUT67,10.1039/c4cc03764b,"Synthesis
All chemicals used to synthesize ZrSQU and HfSQU were commercially obtained 
from ABCR and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. A typical 
synthesis of ZrSQU is performed in an 11 mL borosilicate glass reactor wherein 
0.24 mmol (56 mg) ZrCl4 is dissolved in a mixture of 64 mmol (5 mL) of N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) and 70 mmol (4 mL) of acetic acid (AA). To this 
solution 0.72 mmol (82 mg) of SQA is added together with 12 mmol of HCl (1 ml 
HCl 37%). The molar ratio ZrCl4/SQA/HCl/H2O/DMF/AA equals 
1/3/50/174/267/292. This mixture is reacted at 383 K for 2-3 h, after which a white 
precipitate has formed (92 % yield based on Zr). The as-synthesized material is 
separated by centrifugation and washed several times with DMF and acetone 
followed by a drying step in air at 333 K for 24 h. Replacing ZrCl4 with HfCl4
enables the formation of the isostructural hafnium squarate. The use of a 
monocarboxylic modulator as well as HCl is required to obtain powder of sufficient 
crystallinity. ZrSQU can also be synthesized using formic acid (FA). In this case 
the optimal molar ratio ZrCl4/SQA/HCl/H2O/DMF/FA is found to be 
1/3/25/87/373/276. The synthesis and washing procedures are in each case 
identical as in the previously described method. In absence of modulator no 
product was formed. Similarly, in absence of DMF no crystallization occurred due 
to the low solubility of squaric acid in the resulting synthesis solution."

at 150 °C for 48 h to obtain a fully evacuated sample of lp-
[Al(OH)(bdc)]. The evacuated sample was flame-sealed under
vacuum.
The synthesis of [AlF(bdc)] was developed from the previously
reported method19 with replacement of the solvent dimethylformamide (DMF) by DEF. AlF3 (0.0084 g) was dissolved in 10 mL DEF
followed by addition of H2bdc (0.996 g). The mixture was then loaded
into a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave that was heated at
220 °C for 4 days. The mother liquor was removed by suction
filtration leaving a white fine powder product that was washed with 20
mL of DMF prior to being stirred overnight in 15 mL of methanol.
The powder was recovered by filtration and dried at 70 °C before
being calcined in static air at 300 °C for 24 h in order to remove any
occluded guest molecules from the framework. Successful synthesis of
[AlF(bdc)] is indicated by the powder X-ray diffraction pattern (see
Supporting Information Figure SI3) and thermogravimetric analysis
data (see Supporting Information Figure SI4). A sample of [AlF(bdc)]
was packed into a 0.5 mm diameter borosilicate capillary tube and
evacuated at 2.1 × 10−1 mbar at 200 °C for 24 h to obtain a fully

flame-sealed under vacuum. Another sample of [AlF(bdc)] was packed
into a 0.5 mm diameter aluminum capillary tube and evacuated at 2.1

Zn(NO3)2·4H2O (13.8 mg, 52.8 µmol) in dry DEF (1.0 mL) and water (30 
µL) in a 4 mL vial which had been treated with Sigmacote. The mixture 
was sonicated for 5 minutes before being heated in an 85 °C isothermal

yield calculation, TGA and NMR analysis, the mother liquor was decanted 
and replaced with anhydrous DMF. The DMF was then replaced with fresh anhydrous DMF and this process 
was repeated for 5 times. The crystals were isolated by filtration and allowed to dry on a filter paper. Yield:

H3hmtt, 0.15 mmol H2bpdc, 0.15 mmol H2bdc, 1.056 mol Zn(NO3)2·4H2O and 0.6 mL water). The reaction was 
carried out in a Sigmacote-treated 100 mL Schott bottle at 85 °C.

H3hett (4.9 mg, 7.6 µmol), biphenyl-4,4’-dicarboxylic acid (3.0 mg, 12 µmol) 
and terephthalic acid (1.3 mg, 7.8 µmol) were combined with 
Zn(NO3)2·4H2O (13.8 mg, 52.8 µmol) in dry DEF (1.0 mL) and water (50 
µL) in a 4 mL vial which had been treated with Sigmacote. The reaction 
mixture was sonicated for 5 minutes before being heated in an 85 °C 
isothermal oven for 19 hours to obtain pale yellow crystals of MUF-77-
ethyl. For yield calculation, TGA and NMR analysis, the mother liquor was 
decanted and replaced with anhydrous DMF. The DMF was then replaced with fresh anhydrous DMF and this 
process was repeated for 5 times. The crystals were isolated by filtration and allowed to dry on a filter paper.

H3hett, 0.25 mmol H2bpdc, 0.15 mmol H2bdc, 1.056 mol Zn(NO3)2·4H2O and 0.6 mL water). The reaction was 
carried out in a Sigmacote-treated 100 mL Schott bottle at 85 °C.
It is found that a rod shaped MOF [Zn2(hett)+
] as a competing phase could form ocasionally in small quantities 
during the synthesis when water content is lower than 3 %. This phase can be competely eliminated by 
adding around 10 seeding crystals of MUF-77-ethyl to the reaction mixture prior to solvothermal reactions.
