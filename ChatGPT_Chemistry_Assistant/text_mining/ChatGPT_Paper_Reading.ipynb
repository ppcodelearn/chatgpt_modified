      "Poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl ethers (PODEn) are environmentally benign diesel additives with\n",
      "the formula of H3C-O-(CH2O)n-CH3(n ≥ 2) [1]. PODEn of chain lengths n = 3–5 have suitable ﬂash\n",
      "points [2] and melting points [3], which could reduce the soot and also, indirectly, NOx during the\n",
      "combustion process in compression ignition engines [4–6]. Thus, higher combustion eﬃciency could\n",
      "be achieved by blending PODEn in diesel [7,8]. Moreover, PODEn can be used as oxygenated fuels to\n",
      "direct oxidation fuel cells [9] and as green solvents for the chemical industry [10,11].\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Two kinds of synthesized educts are necessary for the synthesis of PODEn: end-group (CH3O-)\n",
      "providers, such as methylal (DMM), methanol (MeOH), or dimethyl ethers (DME) and chain-group\n",
      "(-CH2O-) providers, such as trioxane (TOX), formaldehyde (FA) or paraformaldehyde (PF) [12,13].\n",
      "All these providers can be synthesized by methanol at the very start. Poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl\n",
      "ethers is a key research direction for coal-based methanol, facing serious oversupply in China [14].\n",
      "In the published articles, there are possible synthesis routes and technologies for production of PODEn:\n",
      "DMM/TOX route [15–17], DMM/PF route [14,18], DME/ TOX route [19,20], and MeOH/FA solution\n",
      "route [21–23]. The routes of DMM/TOX, DME/TOX, and DMM/PF have a high yield of PODE3−5 [14,15],\n",
      "but these routes have high costs due to chain-group providers TOX and PF. In contrast, the route using\n",
      "MeOH/FA solution has a lower yield of PODE3−5 [23,24]. Methylal and PODE2 are the main oligomers\n",
      "in the MeOH/FA solution route due to the Schulz−Flory distribution of PODEn products [25–27].\n",

      "Water in the reactants leads to the decomposition of PODEn, which is the main reason for the decrease\n",
      "of PODE3–5 [4]. Therefore, the selectivity of PODE3−5 can be improved by reducing water content in\n",
      "feedstock. Meanwhile, water not only aﬀects the yield of PODE3–5 but also makes the puriﬁcation\n",
      "process more complicated [28]. Therefore, the eﬀects of water on the PODEn process represent one of\n",

      "Large scale green production of PODEn would be crucial if diesel-PODEn blends are applied to\n",
      "tackle the worldwide formidable air pollution by particulate matter. In the articles, Burger et al. [29]\n",
      "conceptually designed a large scale production in which PODEn was formed from methylal and TOX.\n",
      "Tsinghua University [30] provided a technology synthesizing PODEn from methylal and PF, which was\n",
      "applied in practice in Shandong Yuhuang Chemical Co., Ltd. in China. Schmitz et al. [31] designed a\n",
      "conceptual process for the production of PODEn by the route using the MeOH/FA solution. In addition\n",
      "to the above manufacturing procedure, there are also many articles about the PODEn process [32,33].\n",
      "In the articles, there is no detail on the eﬀects of water content on the manufacturing procedure and it\n",
      "still needs to be explored. In the present work, we will focus on the eﬀects of water content on the\n",
      "PODEn process, especially energetic eﬃciency. To attain this goal, a complete PODEn process with\n",
      "lower water content needs to be established, which our group has already provided [34]. We continue\n",
      "to develop this process in this work. We explored by rigorous simulation that methylal is separated as\n",
      "a distillate product from mixtures containing formaldehyde, water, methanol, methylal, and PODE2.\n",

      "model, the non-idealities in the liquid phase are taken into account using a UNIFAC-based activity\n",
      "coeﬃcient model. In very recent work, the model of Schmitz et al. [46] parametrizes and validates\n",
      "the model using only liquid–liquid equilibrium and not vapor–liquid equilibrium in PODE2-H2O\n",
      "systems. In this work, PODE2 is a light key component that aﬀects the separation to obtain the\n",
      "product. The vapor–liquid equilibrium of PODE2–H2O has inﬂuences on analysis and simulation.\n",
      "Therefore, the present work closes the gap by measuring and regressing vapor–liquid equilibria data\n",

      "Based on our previous work [34], a ﬂowsheet of the novel PODEn production process is depicted\n",

      "column C3 separates methylal as a distillate product (stream 7) from mixtures containing formaldehyde,\n",
      "water, mathanol, methylal, and PODE2 (stream 8), which are recycled back to the reactor. It is well\n",

      "azeotrope, therefore, we can obtain high-purity methylal. The batch distillation experiments are given\n",
      "in supporting information. We will explore the reasons for the rigorous simulation in the following\n",
      "section. The other is water and PODE2 is separated by heterogeneous azeotropic distillation. Water is\n",
      "obtained from column C6 as bottom product (stream 15), and PODE2 is obtained from column C7 as\n",

      "and H2O, is fed to the acidic catalyzed reactor R1 to produce PODEn after mixing with the recycle\n",
      "streams 6 and 7. The reactor outlet stream 2 comprising formaldehyde, H2O, methanol, methylal, and\n",
      "PODEn of various chain lengths is fed to a rectifying sequence to separate main products of PODE3−5\n",
      "and recycle other components. The column C1 separates PODEn of chain lengths n ≥ 3 as the bottom\n",
      "product (stream 4), which avoid formaldehyde polymerization when all other light components are\n",
      "distilled together as overhead products (stream 3). Column C2 separates target products of PODE3−5\n",
      "and recycles other components back to the reactor. Column C3 separates methylal as an overhead\n",
      "product (stream 7) from mixture formaldehyde, H2O, methanol, methylal and PODE2 (stream 8) which\n",
      "are recycled back to the reactor. Column C4 using water as entrainer can separate formaldehyde from\n",
      "the system (PODE2 + formaldehyde + H2O + methanol). Thus, formalin can be segregated from the\n",
      "intricate mixture by stream 11. For column C5, it is proved that methanol is obtained in a sharp split\n",
      "as a top product (stream 12), and PODE2 with water is obtained as the bottom product (stream 13).\n",
      "Finally, water is obtained from column C6 as the bottom product (stream 15), and PODE2 is obtained\n",

      "Abstract: Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is a highly valuable product in the chemical industry. It is\n",
      "widely used as an extracting agent for heavy metals, antibiotics, and lubricating oils. Generally, MIBK\n",
      "can be produced by three-step and one-step liquid-phase methods. These methods are expensive\n",
      "and energy-demanding due to the high pressure and low conversion of acetone. A novel nano-\n",
      "Pd/nano-ZnCr2O4 catalyst was developed to produce MIBK with high conversion and selectivity\n",
      "of 77.3% and 72.1%, respectively, at 350 ◦C and ambient pressure, eliminating the need for high\n",
      "pressure in conventional MIBK processes. This study is the ﬁrst that proposes a newly developed\n",
      "process of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) production using the low-pressure one-step gas-phase\n",
      "selective hydrogenation of acetone. In this work, a novel process ﬂow diagram has been developed\n",
      "for the production of MIBK using the developed nano-catalyst. The process was heat integrated,\n",
      "resulting in a 26% and a 19.5% reduction in the heating and cooling utilities, respectively, leading to\n",
      "a 12.6% reduction in the total energy demand. An economic analysis was performed to determine\n",
      "the economic feasibility of the developed process, which shows that the process is highly proﬁtable,\n",
      "in which it reduced both the capital and operating costs of MIBK synthesis and showed a return on\n",
      "investment (ROI) of 29.6% with a payback period of 2.2 years. It was found that the ROI could be\n",
      "increased by 18% when the reactor temperature is increased to 350 ◦C. In addition, the economic\n",
      "sensitivity analysis showed that the process is highly sensitive to product prices and least sensitive to\n",
      "utility prices, which is due to the versatility of the process that requires only a low amount of energy.\n",

      "MIBK can be produced by several processes, but essentially by a three-step [11] method\n",
      "and a single-step method [12–17]. Each of these processes can be carried out with different\n",
      "catalysts, raw materials, and reaction conditions [12]. The three-step method involves aldol\n",
      "condensation of acetone over homogeneous aqueous-based catalysts, such as sodium and\n",
      "calcium hydroxide, forming diacetone alcohol (DAA), which is subsequently dehydrated\n",
      "to mesityl oxide (MO). The ﬁnal step is the selective hydrogenation of the C=C bond of MO\n",
      "to MIBK using Cu or Ni catalysts [18,19]. The most commonly occurring side reactions are\n",
      "over-condensation and unselective hydrogenation [20].\n",

      "condensation, and product puriﬁcation [18,19,21]. Alternatively, the one-step process\n",
      "using a metal-supported catalyst was demonstrated to be more efﬁcient [22–28]. The\n",
      "support catalyzes acetone condensation to mesityl oxide (MO), an α,β-unsaturated ketone,\n",
      "followed by in situ catalytic reductions to MIBK using palladium on acidic ion-exchange\n",
      "resins [18,29,30], while there are other processes that use Pd/zirconium phosphate [31].\n",
      "In the one-step liquid-phase process, hydrogen and acetone are passed over metal base\n",
      "catalysts at moderate temperature and high pressure to produce MIBK in a single step,\n",
      "saving enormous costs that are required in the three-step method [32]. Under these reaction\n",

      "The petrochemical industry is a highly volatile market that has experienced many\n",
      "ups and downs throughout its market history [47,48]. Therefore, to account for these\n",
      "perturbations, raw material costs, product costs, utility costs, and ﬁxed capital costs were\n",
      "varied by ±15% of their current prices. Figure 7 shows the overall sensitivity analysis\n",
      "of the above factors at a constant production rate and 10 years of operation. It shows\n",
      "that the process is highly dependent on the product prices, in which a 10% increase could\n",
      "make the process an extremely lucrative process with an ROI of 54.3%. However, a 15%\n",
      "decrease could make the process unproﬁtable with an ROI of 4.1%. The ﬂuctuation in the\n",
      "product prices gave maximum and minimum values of ROI in the sensitivity analysis,\n",
      "which represents the importance of reducing the MIBK losses throughout the process. On\n",
      "the other hand, raw material prices come in as a second large contributor to the process\n",
      "proﬁtability, in which a 15% increase in the raw material prices decreases the ROI to\n",
      "12.7%, whereas a 15% reduction in the raw material prices increases the ROI to 46%. This\n",
      "highlights how crucial it is to properly recover unreacted raw materials (e.g., acetone\n",
      "and hydrogen), in addition to the great inﬂuence that the higher selectivity can have on\n",
      "the process proﬁtability. The ﬁxed capital investment was found to be the third largest\n",
      "contributor, with an ROI of 23.5% if its cost increased by 15% and an ROI of 37.7% if\n",
      "its cost decreased by 15%. This also highlights that even though recovering more of the\n",
      "product and raw materials can increase the TCI, it has a lower negative inﬂuence on the\n",
      "process proﬁtability than losing them. In addition, it is worth noting that the utility cost,\n",
      "as expected, has an insigniﬁcant impact on the ROI as the current utility cost is $1.646\n",
      "million per year, representing only 2.95% of the total product cost, which is due to the\n",

      "The temperature for reactor operation proposed by Al-Rabiah et al. [40,41] is in the\n",
      "range of (200–350) ◦C. The conducted sensitivity analysis has shown that it is appealing\n",
      "to increase the conversion and selectivity of the process. In the current study, the used\n",
      "temperature is 300 ◦C. When the reactor temperature is increased to 350 ◦C, the conver-\n",
      "sion and selectivity are increased from 66% and 69.4% to 77.3% and 72.2%, respectively.\n",
      "Consequently, less acetone is required, and more MIBK is produced. Nevertheless, this\n",
      "also increases the heating requirement needed for the feed stream as well as the reactor\n",
      "cooling system. In order to determine the optimum temperature in terms of proﬁtability,\n",
      "the process was simulated at 350 ◦C. All costs were determined in the same manner as\n",
      "previously done. Figure 8 shows that as the reactor temperature increases, the ﬁxed capital\n",
      "investment decreases, which is due to the lower volume of the distillation column T-101 that\n",
      "is needed to separate acetone from the process stream. In addition, the rest of the columns’\n",
      "size remained almost the same as the production rate was ﬁxed. In addition, the cost of the\n",
      "compressor decreased because the numbers of unreacted moles of acetone and hydrogen\n",
      "were lower. On the other hand, the heating utility that is required to maintain the reactor\n",
      "temperature was increased by about 10%. In addition, more heating utility was required\n",
      "for E-102 because the minimum temperature approach was increased from 10 ◦C to 30 ◦C\n",
      "to prevent a phase change prior to the compressor. It is worth noting that even though\n",
      "the inlet temperature to E-105 was increased from 164 ◦C to 180 ◦C, the heat duty was\n",
      "about 11% less due to the lower ﬂow rate entering the heat exchanger. The condenser and\n",
      "reboiler heat loads of T-101 were also lower due to the lower amount of unreacted acetone.\n",
      "An overall assessment of energy consumption is shown in Figure 8, which indicates that\n",
      "increasing the temperature from 300 ◦C to 350 ◦C reduces the overall energy consumption\n",
      "of the process. Furthermore, the ROI increased to 34.3%, and the payback period decreased\n",

      "Abstract: The traditional two-column reactive distillation (RD) process is used for the production\n",
      "of butyric anhydride, which is synthesized with butyric acid and acetic anhydride via a reversible\n",
      "reaction.\n",
      "In this work, a novel process with a single RD column (SRDC) is designed for the\n",
      "production of butyric anhydride, where the second distillation column for separating excess reactant\n",
      "is removed based on the boiling point proﬁle of the reaction system. Two applications of the proposed\n",
      "SRDC process, namely SRDC with excess butyric acid or acetic anhydride circulating internally, are\n",
      "economically optimized, and the results show that both SRDC processes have a lower total annual\n",
      "cost (TAC) than the traditional two-column process. Furthermore, from the perspective of TAC,\n",
      "the application with an excess feed of butyric acid is better than the application with excess acetic\n",
      "anhydride. The developed technique may also be applied to retroﬁt other traditional two-column RD\n",
      "processes, where the overhead and bottom products are the lightest and heaviest components of the\n",

      "butyric anhydride. RD is an intensiﬁed process which couples the chemical reaction with distillation\n",
      "separation in one piece of equipment, thus equipment costs are reduced. RD can also improve the\n",
      "conversion and yield of the reversible reaction by removing the product from the reaction system in\n",
      "time; in addition, the concentration of reactants increases and the reaction rate also increases as the\n",
      "products are moved out. In the past decades, the batch RD process has been used to produce butyric\n",
      "anhydride [1], with the purity of butyric anhydride being high. The main disadvantages of the batch\n",
      "process include diﬃculty of operation, long production period, high labor costs due to the diﬃculty of\n",
      "automation, and high energy consumption due to the need to steam out the transition components [1].\n",
      "In recent years, continuous manufacturing processes have been introduced to produce ﬁne\n",

      "In the present study, an exergy analysis of a process configuration able to avoid carbon emissions and to produce DME and methanol is presented. The carbon-emitting source in this study was a 189 MW power plant. The Brayton–Joule cycle in the power plant was mainly responsible for exergy destruction, 75% of the produced carbon dioxide was captured to be stored underground and the remaining 25% was to be transformed into DME and methanol via reactions with hydrogen. In the plant, the total CO2 generated by the power cycle was 119,068 kg/h, the amount stored was 89,288 kg/h, the stream converted was 26,815 kg/h and the amount vented to the atmosphere was 2965 kg/h (2.5% of the total). The reaction sections converted the CO2 stream into DME (10,381 kg/h) and methanol (3214.1 kg/h). A second route was considered, i.e., the storage of 100% of the CO2 generated by the power plant.\n",

      "The processes were ﬁrst implemented in Matlab in order to critically analyze the number\n",
      "of reactor modules, the purge fraction, and the reactor operating temperature. Using the\n",
      "most suitable process parameters, detailed plants of both approaches were implemented\n",
      "in Aspen Plus, including heat integration and a water Rankine cycle to make use of the\n",
      "reaction enthalpy. Finally, techno-economic analyses were applied. Both processes offered\n",

      "Abstract: Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) is a viable solution to valorise the CO2 captured\n",
      "from industrial plants’ ﬂue gas, thus avoiding emitting it and synthesizing products with high added\n",
      "value. On the other hand, using CO2 as a reactant in chemical processes is a challenging task, and a\n",
      "rigorous analysis of the performance is needed to evaluate the real impact of CCU technologies in\n",
      "terms of efﬁciency and environmental footprint. In this paper, the energetic performance of a DME\n",
      "and methanol synthesis process fed by 25% of the CO2 captured from a natural gas combined cycle\n",

      "The remaining 75% of the CO2 was compressed and stored underground. The process was assessed\n",
      "by means of an exergetic analysis and compared to post-combustion Carbon Capture and Storage\n",
      "(CCS), where 100% of the CO2 captured was stored underground. Through the exergy analysis, the\n",
      "quality degradation of energy was quantiﬁed, and the sources of irreversibility were detected. The\n",
      "carbon-emitting source was a 189 MW Brayton–Joule power plant, which was mainly responsible\n",
      "for exergy destruction. The CCU conﬁguration showed a higher exergy efﬁciency than the CCS,\n",
      "but higher exergy destruction per non-emitted carbon dioxide. In the DME/methanol production\n",
      "plant, the main contribution to exergy destruction was given by the distillation column separating\n",
      "the reactor outlet stream and, in particular, the top-stage condenser was found to be the component\n",
      "with the highest irreversibility (45% of the total). Additionally, the methanol/DME synthesis reactor\n",
      "destroyed a signiﬁcant amount of exergy (24%). Globally, DME/methanol synthesis from CO2 and\n",

      "The extensive concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a threat to environ-\n",

      "In the present study, an exergy analysis of a process conﬁguration able to avoid carbon\n",
      "emissions and to produce DME and methanol is presented. The carbon-emitting source\n",
      "in this study was a 189 MW power plant. The Brayton–Joule cycle in the power plant\n",
      "was mainly responsible for exergy destruction, 75% of the produced carbon dioxide was\n",
      "captured to be stored underground and the remaining 25% was to be transformed into\n",
      "DME and methanol via reactions with hydrogen. In the plant, the total CO2 generated\n",
      "by the power cycle was 119,068 kg/h, the amount stored was 89,288 kg/h, the stream\n",
      "converted was 26,815 kg/h and the amount vented to the atmosphere was 2965 kg/h (2.5%\n",
      "of the total). The reaction sections converted the CO2 stream into DME (10,381 kg/h) and\n",
      "methanol (3214.1 kg/h). A second route was considered, i.e., the storage of 100% of the\n",

      "Of those two routes to avoid carbon emissions, the underground storage offers a much\n",
      "lower exergy destruction per mass of non-emitted carbon. Inside the DME production plant,\n",
      "the main contribution to exergy destruction was from the distillation column separating\n",
      "the reactor outlet stream and, in particular, the top-stage condenser was found to be the\n",
      "component with the highest irreversibility. This DME synthesis showed a higher efﬁciency\n",
      "than the underground storage unit, but a higher exergy destruction per non-emitted carbon\n",
      "dioxide ratio. As a consequence, the process conﬁguration we propose has higher exergetic\n",
      "efﬁciency and exergy destruction than full geological storage, and produces valuable\n",
      "compounds, such as DME and methanol. Its feasibility is strictly correlated with the\n",

      "Poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl ethers (PODEn) are environmentally benign diesel additives with\n",
      "the formula of H3C-O-(CH2O)n-CH3(n ≥ 2) [1]. PODEn of chain lengths n = 3–5 have suitable ﬂash\n",
      "points [2] and melting points [3], which could reduce the soot and also, indirectly, NOx during the\n",
      "combustion process in compression ignition engines [4–6]. Thus, higher combustion eﬃciency could\n",
      "be achieved by blending PODEn in diesel [7,8]. Moreover, PODEn can be used as oxygenated fuels to\n",
      "direct oxidation fuel cells [9] and as green solvents for the chemical industry [10,11].\n",

      "Two kinds of synthesized educts are necessary for the synthesis of PODEn: end-group (CH3O-)\n",
      "providers, such as methylal (DMM), methanol (MeOH), or dimethyl ethers (DME) and chain-group\n",
      "(-CH2O-) providers, such as trioxane (TOX), formaldehyde (FA) or paraformaldehyde (PF) [12,13].\n",
      "All these providers can be synthesized by methanol at the very start. Poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl\n",
      "ethers is a key research direction for coal-based methanol, facing serious oversupply in China [14].\n",
      "In the published articles, there are possible synthesis routes and technologies for production of PODEn:\n",
      "DMM/TOX route [15–17], DMM/PF route [14,18], DME/ TOX route [19,20], and MeOH/FA solution\n",
      "route [21–23]. The routes of DMM/TOX, DME/TOX, and DMM/PF have a high yield of PODE3−5 [14,15],\n",
      "but these routes have high costs due to chain-group providers TOX and PF. In contrast, the route using\n",
      "MeOH/FA solution has a lower yield of PODE3−5 [23,24]. Methylal and PODE2 are the main oligomers\n",
      "in the MeOH/FA solution route due to the Schulz−Flory distribution of PODEn products [25–27].\n",

      "Water in the reactants leads to the decomposition of PODEn, which is the main reason for the decrease\n",
      "of PODE3–5 [4]. Therefore, the selectivity of PODE3−5 can be improved by reducing water content in\n",
      "feedstock. Meanwhile, water not only aﬀects the yield of PODE3–5 but also makes the puriﬁcation\n",
      "process more complicated [28]. Therefore, the eﬀects of water on the PODEn process represent one of\n",

      "conceptually designed a large scale production in which PODEn was formed from methylal and TOX.\n",
      "Tsinghua University [30] provided a technology synthesizing PODEn from methylal and PF, which was\n",
      "applied in practice in Shandong Yuhuang Chemical Co., Ltd. in China. Schmitz et al. [31] designed a\n",
      "conceptual process for the production of PODEn by the route using the MeOH/FA solution. In addition\n",
      "to the above manufacturing procedure, there are also many articles about the PODEn process [32,33].\n",
      "In the articles, there is no detail on the eﬀects of water content on the manufacturing procedure and it\n",
      "still needs to be explored. In the present work, we will focus on the eﬀects of water content on the\n",
      "PODEn process, especially energetic eﬃciency. To attain this goal, a complete PODEn process with\n",
      "lower water content needs to be established, which our group has already provided [34]. We continue\n",
      "to develop this process in this work. We explored by rigorous simulation that methylal is separated as\n",
      "a distillate product from mixtures containing formaldehyde, water, methanol, methylal, and PODE2.\n",

      "model, the non-idealities in the liquid phase are taken into account using a UNIFAC-based activity\n",
      "coeﬃcient model. In very recent work, the model of Schmitz et al. [46] parametrizes and validates\n",
      "the model using only liquid–liquid equilibrium and not vapor–liquid equilibrium in PODE2-H2O\n",
      "systems. In this work, PODE2 is a light key component that aﬀects the separation to obtain the\n",
      "product. The vapor–liquid equilibrium of PODE2–H2O has inﬂuences on analysis and simulation.\n",

      "        was mainly responsible for exergy destruction, 75% of the produced carbon dioxide was\n",
      "        captured to be stored underground and the remaining 25% was to be transformed into\n",

      "Abstract: A readily available source for renewable fuels and chemicals is corn stover, which consists\n",
      "of the leftover stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs from the corn plant and makes up nearly half of the yield\n",
      "of a corn crop. Common practice is to pretreat it with sulfuric acid to break down the hemicellulose,\n",
      "releasing xylose, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis to convert the cellulose into glucose. Using a\n",
      "Sn-Beta catalyst, it is possible to convert these monomeric sugars into lactic, levulinic, formic, and\n",
      "acetic acids. This paper presents the results of a techno-economic analysis (TEA) of the commercial\n",
      "feasibility of producing these acids from corn stover. Two preliminary process designs were evaluated\n",
      "which represent two separate reaction yields: a balanced yield of both lactic and levulinic acids and\n",
      "the yields from a co-catalysis with CaSO4 to produce primarily lactic acid. Both process designs\n",
      "are scaled to process 230,000 MT/year of corn stover. An AACS Class 4 factored broad capital cost\n",
      "estimate and comparable estimates of operating costs and revenues were used to generate cash ﬂow\n",
      "sheets to evaluate the economic feasibility of both options. The balanced product process has an\n",
      "estimated NPV@20% = $3.3 million ± 40%, while the CaSO4-facilited process has an NPV@20%\n",
      "= $110 million ± 40% (January 2019 basis). A major hurdle for both processes is the demand for\n",
      "levulinic acid. The balanced product process will produce 135% of the expected global demand and\n",
      "the CaSO4-facilitated alternative will meet 31% of the demand. For the demand to meet production,\n",
      "advances in levulinic acid applications are needed. However, the attractive economics suggest that\n",

      "Changes to the global environment have resulted in a concerted effort to transition\n",

      "cellulosic biomass is substantial. One of the most readily available sources in the United\n",

      "such as formic and acetic acid [3–6]. The reaction of glucose follows one of two reaction\n",
      "pathways. The ﬁrst is retro-aldol condensation, which splits the six-carbon sugar in the\n",
      "presence of a Lewis acid [7]. This produces two three-carbon trioses, which can both be\n",
      "isomerized to lactic acid [7]. As a side reaction, these trioses can decompose to acetic and\n",

      "Lactic acid is a renewable chemical that can serve as an alternative to fossil fuel\n",

      "require alternative uses for the end-products or subsequent conversion of the esters to\n",

      "extract the sugars out of their water solution so they can be transferred to methanol, as\n",

      "Our recent work [16] found that the addition of CaSO4 to aqueous reactions mixtures\n",

      "sulfate ions present in the solution that help to neutralize Brønsted acid sites present on\n",
      "the surface of Sn-Beta. The loss of these sites suppresses the production of dehydration\n",
      "side-products. Additionally, calcium ions act as a second Lewis acid, acting in tandem with\n",
      "tin to improve the yield of the retro-aldol pathway. This results in a lactic acid yield of\n",
      "68 wt% of the inlet carbon, signiﬁcantly closer to the 75% yield obtained in methanol [15].\n",

      "Between the two process alternatives, the biggest difference in utility costs results\n",
      "from differences in electricity requirements. This is due to higher hydrochar production\n",
      "in the base Sn-Beta alternative. As a result, more compressed air is required for catalyst\n",
      "calcination, leading to a larger compressor duty and subsequent higher use of compressor\n",
      "motor power. An additional difference is that the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternative requires\n",
      "more than double the high-pressure steam than the base Sn-Beta alternative. This is\n",
      "due to an increase in lactic acid, resulting in a higher reboiler duty for the TMA/water\n",
      "recovery column. Since the reboiler operates higher than the condensation point of high-\n",
      "pressure steam, the cooled utility is then used as medium-high-pressure steam, lowering\n",
      "its production requirement. Overall, the annual utility requirements were estimated to be\n",

      "In addition to revenue from the products, two operating credits also generate signiﬁ-\n",

      "process designs produce more low-pressure steam than is consumed in the process. To\n",
      "avoid the production of useless steam, it was decided to use boiler-feed water rather than\n",
      "cooling water to cool the process stream before furfural extraction and to then heat it to\n",
      "just below its saturation point with the excess steam. The saturated water is then sent to\n",
      "the utility boiler to produce the grades of steam that are not in excess. Heating the water\n",
      "to its saturation point consumes about 21% of the energy required to make this steam.\n",
      "This energy recovery saves $3.2 million and $3.5 million per year for the two respective\n",

      "The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of catalytically transforming\n",
      "corn stover-derived sugars into lactic acid or both lactic and levulinic acids as primary\n",
      "products. While previous studies on Sn-Beta-facilitated conversion have documented\n",
      "reaction conditions, the economics of a process based on this technology has not been\n",
      "previously evaluated. Two separate process alternatives were examined. We ﬁrst evaluated\n",
      "the conversion of extracted sugars to carboxylic acids solely through the use of Sn-Beta.\n",
      "This resulted in the co-production of lactic and levulinic acid as major products. The second\n",
      "process included calcium sulfate as part of the reaction mixture, signiﬁcantly increasing the\n",
      "reaction selectivity towards lactic acid. Both process alternatives produced other valuable\n",
      "by-products that are worth purifying to a sellable grade, such as formic and acetic acid,\n",
      "calcium sulfate, and furfural. Process plant throughput was determined by feeding the\n",
      "corn stover equivalent to corn kernel feed in a typical bioethanol plant. This set the input\n",
      "of both processes at 250,000 tons of corn stover per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: No.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Process separation steps utilized reactive extraction to remove carboxylic acids from\n",
      "the reaction solutions. To deﬁne optimal conditions for the co-extraction of lactic, levulinic,\n",
      "acetic, and formic acids, both screening and optimization experiments were conducted.\n",
      "Based on the screening experiments, it was determined that the most signiﬁcant factors\n",
      "are the aqueous/organic phase ratio, extractant concentration, acid composition, and\n",
      "diluent type. Optimal conditions for both examined diluents, 1-octanol and isoamyl,\n",
      "were determined using a central composite design. Based on these conditions, it was\n",
      "determined that extraction with a 1-octanol diluent was more economical based on the\n",
      "simpler downstream separation requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was found that both processes were proﬁtable with the base Sn-Beta design being\n",
      "valued at an NPV@20% of $3.3 million while the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 design reached an\n",
      "NPV@20% of $110 million. The lower proﬁtability of the base case is due to the lower\n",
      "carbon conversion of carbohydrates to saleable carboxylic acid products. For the base case\n",
      "to be more proﬁtable, levulinic acid would need to be sold at a price $5.39/kg higher than\n",
      "that of lactic acid. The economics for both alternatives are sensitive to the gross proﬁt\n",
      "margin, and the base case is also sensitive to the capital investment. Neither alternative\n",

      "\n",
      "No\n",

      "A major hurdle for both processes is market demand for the levulinic acid co-product.\n",
      "Though global demand for levulinic acid is expected to increase in the coming years, the\n",

      "to meet projected future production based on the technologies evaluated in this work,\n",

      "The use of renewable sources with the aim of moving from a fossil-based economy to a\n",
      "more sustainable economy based on biomass is the object of numerous research efforts and\n",
      "policy developments to implement this transition [1–3]. The carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua L.)\n",
      "is an evergreen tree typical of the Mediterranean region whose pod can be classiﬁed into two\n",
      "parts, the kibble (locust bean), which represents between 80–90%w/w of the pod, and the\n",
      "seeds or kernels (locust kernel gum), which account for 20–10%w/w of the pod. The kibble\n",
      "is mainly used for livestock feeding, while the seeds are used to produce locust bean gum,\n",
      "which in turn is very much appreciated by the food industry. The primary composition of\n",
      "carob kibble consists of 32–42%w/w sucrose, 7–10%w/w glucose, 10–12%w/w fructose, and\n",
      "minor amounts of amino acids, minerals, and phenolic compounds [4]. Despite that, carob\n",
      "kibble has minimal commercial value for farmers, and its chemical composition makes it a\n",
      "cheap carbon and nitrogen source to be used in fermentative processes for the production\n",
      "of bio-based chemicals [5]. Among the different bio-based chemicals that can be produced\n",
      "through fermentation processes, lactic acid (LA) is one of the primary platform chemicals\n",
      "for the green chemistry of the future because it has both carboxylic and hydroxyl groups,\n",
      "providing a high versatility to be used as a precursor of several valuable chemicals such as\n",
      "acrylic acid (AA) [6,7]. AA is a bulk chemical that is used in the manufacture of plastics,\n",
      "coatings, adhesives, elastomers, ﬂoor polishes, and paints which are mainly produced by\n",
      "propylene oxidation. Around 6 million tons of AA are produced annually. The global\n",
      "market for AA and its derivatives is expected to increase at an annual rate of 3.5% during\n",
      "the 2020–2025 period; therefore, there is great interest in replacing the petrol-based AA\n",

      "The feasibility study considered different process configurations for carbon dioxide utilization and storage. The authors propose a process that avoids carbon emissions and produces dimethyl ether (DME) and methanol. The process involves capturing 75% of the carbon dioxide generated by a power plant and storing it underground, while the remaining 25% is transformed into DME and methanol through reactions with hydrogen. The process configuration aims to achieve high exergetic efficiency and minimize exergy destruction. The details of the process design and simulation are not provided in this context.

      "of CO2 to methanol and then conversion of methanol to dimethyl ether using Aspen Plus® (V.11,\n",
      "Aspen Technology, Inc., Bedford, Massachusetts 01730, USA). Hydrogen was obtained from alkaline\n",
      "water electrolysis, proton exchange membrane and solid oxide electrolysis processes for methanol\n",
      "production. The major cost contributing factor in the methanol production was the cost of hydrogen\n",
      "production; therefore, the cost per ton of methanol was highest for alkaline water electrolysis and\n",
      "lowest for solid oxide electrolysis. The speciﬁc cost of methanol for solid oxide electrolysis, proton\n",
      "exchange membrane and alkaline water electrolysis was estimated to be 701 $/ton, 760 $/ton and\n",
      "920 $/ton, respectively. Similarly, the speciﬁc cost of dimethyl ether was estimated to be 1141 $/ton,\n",
      "1230 $/ton and 1471 $/ton, using solid oxide electrolysis, proton exchange membrane and alkaline\n",
      "water electrolysis based hydrogen production, respectively. The cost for methanol and dimethyl ether\n",

      "The simulation results demonstrate that methanol production by hydrogenation of\n",
      "CO2 along with dehydration of methanol to DME has the potential to mitigate CO2 emis-\n",
      "sions. The technique also responds to the issues of GHGs emissions and global warming.\n",
      "The production of DME and methanol would not only reduce the consumption of fossil\n",
      "fuels but also provide feedstock for various chemicals. However, currently these processes\n",
      "are economically infeasible owing to the high cost associated with hydrogen production\n",
      "using water electrolysis techniques. The cost of hydrogen production by water electrolysis\n",
      "techniques must be reduced and still further improvements are required for commer-\n",
      "cial implementation of these processes. If the utility services for methanol and DME are\n",
      "supplied by RE sources instead of conventional processes, the net CO2 emissions would\n",
      "decrease. The cost per ton of methanol is $920/ton for AEL, $760/ton and $701/ton using\n",
      "PEM and SOE, respectively. The cost for methanol is highest using AEL and lowest using\n",
      "SOE. However, this cost is still signiﬁcantly higher than the market price of methanol, i.e.,\n",
      "539 $/ton [38]. This study reports that in the methanol production process, the major cost\n",
      "burden is the hydrogen production. Hydrogen production by SOE required 416 MW of elec-\n",
      "trical energy, signiﬁcantly lower than that required by AEL (590 MW) and PEM (652 MW).\n",
      "The cost per ton of DME using SOE-Methanol-DME production, PEM-Methanol-DME\n",
      "production and AEL-Methanol-DME production is $1141/ton, $1230/ton and $1471/ton,\n",
      "respectively. The SOE-Methanol-DME production process has the lowest cost for DME but\n",
      "is still 30% higher than the market price of DME, i.e., $888/ton.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is clear from the above discussions that methanol and DME production can mitigate\n",
      "CO2 emissions. Methanol and DME production from CO2 can provide environmentally\n",
      "neutral fuels to power future vehicles. However, these processes can be implemented on\n",
      "a commercial scale if the costs of hydrogen production, notably water electrolysis, are\n",
      "further reduced. Since hydrogen production methods such as AEL, SOE and PEM have an\n",
      "electricity cost of 70 €/MWh [15], if the cost of electricity is reduced or electricity is provided\n",
      "at some discounted rate for the production of hydrogen using water electrolysis, these\n",
      "processes of hydrogen production would be economically feasible and can be implemented\n",
      "on a commercial scale. As for methanol and DME, some other processes for the chemical\n",
      "utilization of CO2, such as production of formaldehyde or acetic acid, can be considered in\n",
      "view of the global concerns of CO2 mitigation, reducing the consumption of fossil fuels\n",

      "Abstract: Waste gases that cannot be released into the environment are generated in chemical\n",
      "industrial processes. There are various physico-chemical processes for the treatment of these gases,\n",
      "but in most cases, they present a major cost to the company. There is an EU directive for each\n",
      "industrial area describing the best available techniques (BAT) and the prescribed environmental limits\n",
      "for the maximum discharge of dangerous substances into the environment. The current process for\n",
      "the removal of formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds from waste industrial gases meets\n",
      "EU environmental regulations. However, expected new EU directives will require a signiﬁcant\n",
      "reduction in formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds’ concentrations in industrial exhaust\n",
      "gases, thus necessitating a new technical solution for the removal of formaldehyde. This paper\n",
      "describes two methods of removing formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds from waste\n",
      "gases, generated by the metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production processes. The ﬁrst method\n",
      "involves upgrading existing processes of removing formaldehyde from waste gases with an additional\n",
      "absorption plant, with which emissions can be signiﬁcantly reduced. The second method describes\n",
      "the co-incineration of waste gases generated by a metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production\n",
      "process with natural gas in a gas turbine, where formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds\n",
      "are completely removed, while electricity is also produced. The second method is also useful for\n",

      "Formalin, an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, is one of the most important base products in the\n",
      "production of high-volume products in the chemical industry [1]. The amount of international trade of\n",
      "formaldehyde today is less than 2% of the total volume of formaldehyde produced. The transport costs\n",
      "for formaldehyde aqueous solutions are very high because of the relatively high proportion of water in\n",
      "the product. Therefore, formaldehyde is usually used or processed at the site of production [2]. Taking\n",
      "into consideration the constant increases in energy expenses in the production of such a high volume\n",
      "of formaldehyde aqueous solutions, an optimal way of increasing eﬃciency is the use of by-product\n",
      "energy, based on energy released in the process, and on oﬀ-gases from the production of formaldehyde\n",
      "from methanol [3]. Energy management has become a very important branch of research in the\n",
      "chemical process industry [4]. New developments include trends toward annual emission coupon\n",
      "distribution aﬀects, limiting time-related components in decision making, and executing the transition\n",

      "Abstract: Synthesis of methanol from recirculated CO2 and H2 produced by water electrolysis allows\n",
      "sustainable production of fuels and chemical storage of energy. Production of renewable methanol\n",
      "has, however, not achieved commercial breakthrough, and novel methods to improve economic\n",
      "feasibility are needed. One possibility is to alter the reaction route to methanol using catalytic\n",
      "alcoholic solvents, which makes the process possible at lower reaction temperatures. To estimate the\n",
      "techno-economic potential of this approach, the feasibilities of the conventional gas-phase process\n",
      "and an alternative liquid-phase process employing 2-butanol or 1-butanol solvents were compared by\n",
      "means of ﬂowsheet modelling and economic analysis. As a result, it was found that despite improved\n",
      "methanol yield, the presence of solvent adds complexity to the process and increases separation costs\n",
      "due to the high volatility of the alcohols and formation of azeotropes. Hydrogen, produced from\n",
      "wind electricity, was the major cost in all processes. The higher cost of the present, non-optimized\n",
      "liquid-phase process is largely explained by the heat required in separation. If this heat could be\n",
      "provided by heat integration, the resulting production costs approach the costs of the gas-phase\n",
      "process. It is concluded that the novel reaction route provides promising possibilities, but new\n",

In the process design, it is important to consider the reaction conditions, catalyst selection, and separation techniques to achieve high conversion and selectivity of CO2 into desired products. Various reaction pathways and catalyst materials have been explored, including direct hydrogenation, electrochemical conversion, and biological conversion. Additionally, process simulation and optimization techniques can be used to optimize the process parameters and improve the overall efficiency of the CO2 conversion process.

      "process was the increased per pass conversion due to the lower reaction temperature and the apparent\n",
      "favorable distribution of products between the gas and liquid phases in the reactor. At the same\n",
      "reaction pressure of 50 bar, the per pass CO2 conversion was increased from 20% in the gas-phase\n",
      "process to 79% in the 2-butanol process and 81% in the 1-butanol phase process. The conversion in\n",
      "the liquid-phase processes was higher than the single-phase equilibrium conversion at the reaction\n",
      "conditions. This is presumably due to the beneﬁcial phase equilibrium, i.e., the evaporation of products\n",
      "from the reacting liquid phase. However, uncertainties in the prediction of the phase distribution\n",
      "were present due to a lack of experimental data at the reaction conditions. In addition, whereas the\n",
      "gas-phase reaction could be modelled in detail using an available kinetic model, the liquid-phase\n",
      "reactions were modelled as equilibrium reactions without considering the reaction kinetics. In practice,\n",

      "noted that signiﬁcant assumptions and simpliﬁcations were made in modelling of the liquid-phase\n",
