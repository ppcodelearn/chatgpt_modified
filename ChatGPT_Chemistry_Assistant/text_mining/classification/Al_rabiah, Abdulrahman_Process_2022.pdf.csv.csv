5,5,"Abstract: Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is a highly valuable product in the chemical industry. It is
widely used as an extracting agent for heavy metals, antibiotics, and lubricating oils. Generally, MIBK
can be produced by three-step and one-step liquid-phase methods. These methods are expensive
and energy-demanding due to the high pressure and low conversion of acetone. A novel nano-
Pd/nano-ZnCr2O4 catalyst was developed to produce MIBK with high conversion and selectivity
of 77.3% and 72.1%, respectively, at 350 ◦C and ambient pressure, eliminating the need for high
pressure in conventional MIBK processes. This study is the ﬁrst that proposes a newly developed
process of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) production using the low-pressure one-step gas-phase
selective hydrogenation of acetone. In this work, a novel process ﬂow diagram has been developed
for the production of MIBK using the developed nano-catalyst. The process was heat integrated,
resulting in a 26% and a 19.5% reduction in the heating and cooling utilities, respectively, leading to
a 12.6% reduction in the total energy demand. An economic analysis was performed to determine
the economic feasibility of the developed process, which shows that the process is highly proﬁtable,
in which it reduced both the capital and operating costs of MIBK synthesis and showed a return on
investment (ROI) of 29.6% with a payback period of 2.2 years. It was found that the ROI could be
increased by 18% when the reactor temperature is increased to 350 ◦C. In addition, the economic
sensitivity analysis showed that the process is highly sensitive to product prices and least sensitive to
utility prices, which is due to the versatility of the process that requires only a low amount of energy.",No.

8,8,"Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is an industrially important chemical worldwide. It can
be used in a wide variety of important applications, including protective surface coating,
vinyl, and acrylic resins, the extraction of metallic salts, and the removal of parafﬁn from
mineral oils [1–5]. It is also used in the production of paints and rubber, as well as a solvent
in a variety of pharmaceuticals and adhesives [6,7].",No
9,9,"The global production of MIBK was 430,000 metric tons in 2020 [8]. The market
for MIBK is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than
6% by 2026. This is due to the increasing demand for MIBK, especially in the synthesis
of antioxidant additives for rubber, and the growing demand for solvents in chemical
processes [9].",No
10,10,"In addition to MIBK, a crucial byproduct is also produced, which is isopropyl alcohol
(IPA). It has tremendous industrial, medical, and hygienic applications, including alcohol
wipes, hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and swabs, which increases the prospects of applying
the MIBK process with minimal waste. According to the Centers for Disease Control and",Answer: No.

20,20,"Prevention (CDC) in the United States, alcohol-based hand sanitizers and cleansing wipes
contain between 60% and 90% of alcohol, and the use of 70% of IPA is recommended [10].
Medical IPA was scientiﬁcally proven as a disinfectant that inactivates viruses such as the
COVID-19 virus.",No
21,21,"MIBK can be produced by several processes, but essentially by a three-step [11] method
and a single-step method [12–17]. Each of these processes can be carried out with different
catalysts, raw materials, and reaction conditions [12]. The three-step method involves aldol
condensation of acetone over homogeneous aqueous-based catalysts, such as sodium and
calcium hydroxide, forming diacetone alcohol (DAA), which is subsequently dehydrated
to mesityl oxide (MO). The ﬁnal step is the selective hydrogenation of the C=C bond of MO
to MIBK using Cu or Ni catalysts [18,19]. The most commonly occurring side reactions are
over-condensation and unselective hydrogenation [20].",Yes.
22,22,"The three-step process produces a considerable amount of wastewater containing
acidic impurities due to the homogeneous catalyst, which creates a corrosive environment
associated with high capital and operating costs for the neutralization process, acetone
condensation, and product puriﬁcation [18,19,21]. Alternatively, the one-step process
using a metal-supported catalyst was demonstrated to be more efﬁcient [22–28]. The
support catalyzes acetone condensation to mesityl oxide (MO), an α,β-unsaturated ketone,
followed by in situ catalytic reductions to MIBK using palladium on acidic ion-exchange
resins [18,29,30], while there are other processes that use Pd/zirconium phosphate [31].
In the one-step liquid-phase process, hydrogen and acetone are passed over metal base
catalysts at moderate temperature and high pressure to produce MIBK in a single step,
saving enormous costs that are required in the three-step method [32]. Under these reaction
conditions, aldol condensation and dehydration are reversible [33], but the catalyst shifts
the equilibrium toward MO, irreversibly hydrogenating it toward MIBK [28].",Yes.
23,23,"Despite the many advantages offered by the liquid-phase one-step process, it suffers
from high pressure, ranging from 3 to 10 MPa [13], which signiﬁcantly increases the capital
and operating costs. This is in addition to the large recycle ﬂow rate due to the low
conversion of acetone, which increases the size of equipment in the recycle loop as well as
the additional energy that is needed for recovering the unreacted acetone in the distillation
column. Therefore, it is an industrial objective to reduce the pressure and increase the
conversion and selectivity to make the process more proﬁtable.",No.
24,24,"Recently, Qianling et al. reported a bifunctional catalyst TiO2/Al2O32 and Pd/Cor for
one-pot liquid-phase synthesis of MIBK from acetone, which provides acetone conversion
of (35–45)% with a selectivity of (80–90)% to MIBK at 150 ◦C and 2.0 MPa [34]. However, the
process still suffers from the high-pressure requirement with moderate acetone conversion.
Baining et al. proposed an alternative support with high thermal stability and adjustable
acid-base property using phosphor-doped h-BN that catalyzes the aldol condensation
and dehydration to provide an acetone conversion of 58.24% and selectivity of 68.39%
to MIBK [35]. In addition, various kinds of support, including metal oxides [19,36,37]
and sulfonated graphene [38,39], have also been a prime focus in the development of the
process.",Answer: Yes.
25,25,"In this context, a novel nanocrystalline zinc chromite-supported nanopalladium (nano-
Pd/nano-ZnCr2O4) catalyst was developed by Bagabas et al. and Al-Rabiah et al. [20,40,41],
which enables the production of MIBK in a one-step gas-phase reaction at atmospheric
pressure. This can overcome the inﬁrmities that the conventional process suffers from.
However, the process requires a temperature of (200–350) ◦C, which is higher than the
conventional process, which uses a temperature of (120–160) ◦C [15].",No
26,26,"The reaction involves base–acid coupling of acetone to form mesityl oxide (MO),
followed by its hydrogenation to methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). The products with this
catalyst are methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the main product, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as
the main byproduct, and diiasobutyl ketone (DIBK), mesityl oxide (MO), and mesitylene
(M) are also formed [20,40,41]. The MIBK produced by low-pressure one-step gas-phase

32,32,"The developed process ﬂow diagram for the production of methyl isobutyl ketone is
shown in Figure 1. A process simulation was conducted using CHEMCAD v.7.1 software
based on a production of 30,000 metric tons of MIBK per annum with 30 days assigned for
maintenance. The thermodynamic model chosen was UNIFAC as a cubic equation of state.
The reactor conversion, selectivity, and feed ratio used in the simulation were based on the
aforementioned experiment.",Answer: Yes.

34,34,"The fresh acetone feed (stream 1) enters the process at 70 ◦C and 1.8 atm in a liquid
phase and is mixed with the recycled acetone (stream 14), which enters at 74 ◦C and 1.8 atm.
Before entering the reactor R-101, the mixed stream is heated to 300 ◦C. The hydrogen
feed is mixed with recycled hydrogen (stream 11) before being heated to 300 ◦C and fed
into reactor R-101. Both reactor feeds pass through valves, V-101 and V-102, to reduce the
pressure in the reactor. The hydrogen–acetone molar feed ratio is maintained at 2:1, as
recommended [40,41]. The reaction proceeds isothermally in the gas phase at 300 ◦C and
1 atm in a ﬁxed bed catalytic reactor (R-101). The conversion of acetone is 66%, with a
selectivity of 69.4% to methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). Other products, such as isopropanol
(IPA) and diiasobutyl ketone (DIBK), are also produced. The selectivity of each of these
substances was determined based on the experimental work, which is shown in Table 1.
The reactor efﬂuent will then be compressed to 6.5 atm to compensate for pressure losses
through the pipelines and to enhance the separation of hydrogen without major product
losses from the process stream at low pressure and high temperature, preventing the use of
cryogenic conditions. MIBK losses at 1 atm are approximately 6 kmol/h. Consequently,
compression is mandatory to avoid cryogenic conditions. At 6.5 atm, the losses drop to
about 0.7 kmol/h of MIBK. After compression, the stream is cooled to 35 ◦C in E-103
before being fed into the ﬂash drum F-101. The overhead stream from ﬂash drum F-101
contains nearly 99.996% of the unreacted hydrogen, which is recycled and mixed with the
fresh hydrogen. The bottom stream from ﬂash drum F-101 (stream 12) is then throttled to
1.8 atm in V-103 before entering the distillation column, T-101. Nearly 99% of the unreacted
acetone is recovered in the overhead stream of T-101, using 48 stages, before being mixed",Yes

37,37,"with the fresh acetone. The acetone/water system forms an azeotropic mixture at higher
compositions; therefore, about 0.04 of the entered water into the column is recovered into
the top stream to maintain the mixture in the column below the azeotropic point. The
bottom stream from T-101 is cooled to 70 ◦C in E-106 before being sent to a water decanter,
D-101, where 90% of the water is removed. The second outlet stream from the decanter
enters the distillation column, T-102, which consists of 34 stages, where 99.28% of the
isopropanol (IPA) is recovered. The remaining water is also separated with IPA in the
distillate stream, and the mixture is then cooled to 40 ◦C in E-109. The purity of IPA in the
top stream of T-102 is almost 68%, which is highly recommended to be used as sanitizer
in the medical industry, and therefore, there is no need to install a further distillation
column for increasing the purity of the IPA. The bottom stream from T-102 enters another
distillation column, T-103, which consists of 67 stages where 99% of the MIBK is recovered
in the overhead stream with a purity of 99.83 wt.%, achieving the product speciﬁcations [14].
The MIBK stream is then cooled to 40 ◦C in E-110 before being sent to the storage tank. The
bottom stream from T-103, which contains the heavy components (e.g., DAA, MO, M, and
DIBK), is cooled to 40 ◦C in E-111.",No.

52,52,"Heat integration is an essential part of the process development. The reduction
in energy usage not only reduces the operating costs but also prevents harmful carbon
emissions in the environment. The required heating and cooling utilities were identiﬁed
for the process as shown in Figure 1. Each process stream was drawn with a tail and a
head representing the supplied temperature and the target temperature, respectively. The
ﬁnal heat exchanger network is shown in Figure 2, where the red and blue lines denote the
hot and cold streams, respectively. The constructed network utilizes the energy content
and high temperature of the reactor efﬂuent to heat up the feed streams. The acetone feed
(stream 2) leaving mixer M-101 will ﬁrst be heated by the reactor efﬂuent from 74.3 ◦C to
242 ◦C, in which no further heating can occur due to the process constraint prohibiting
phase change before the inlet of the compressor. The reactor efﬂuent will be further cooled
by the hydrogen feed (stream 5) until it reaches a minimum temperature approach of
10 ◦C to avoid an excessive large area. The outcome of the heat integration, as shown in
Figure 3, is a reduction in the heating and cooling utilities by 26% and 19.5%, respectively.
The reduction in the total utility demand is about 12.6%.
In terms of economics, the
implemented heat integration has resulted in an increase in the annualized capital cost
by $12,134/year (for 10 years of operation). However, operating costs have decreased by
$611,852/year, indicating a highly plausible energy utilization that satisﬁes both technical
and economic aspects.",Yes.
53,53,"The blue columns in Figure 3 represent the utility demand before the heat integration,
while the green columns represent the current value of the utility demand in the MIBK
process after heat integration. In addition, the ﬁgure is divided into three sections, starting
from the total utility demand, including the combined heating and cooling utilities, then
the heating utility in the middle, while the cooling utility is placed on the right side. The

The direct costs are estimated as a fraction of the purchased equipment costs and include
all the prices of the delivery and installation of the purchased equipment, installed instru-
mentation and control systems, installed piping, electrical systems, yard improvement,
buildings, and service facilities [42]. The direct cost of the developed MIBK process is
$18.34 million per annum. The indirect cost was calculated as a fraction of the direct cost
provided in Plant Design and Economics for Chemical Engineers by Peter and Timmer-
haus [42]. It includes the engineering and supervision costs, construction, legal, contractor,

266,266,4.6. Economic Sensitivity Analysis,No
267,267,"The petrochemical industry is a highly volatile market that has experienced many
ups and downs throughout its market history [47,48]. Therefore, to account for these
perturbations, raw material costs, product costs, utility costs, and ﬁxed capital costs were
varied by ±15% of their current prices. Figure 7 shows the overall sensitivity analysis
of the above factors at a constant production rate and 10 years of operation. It shows
that the process is highly dependent on the product prices, in which a 10% increase could
make the process an extremely lucrative process with an ROI of 54.3%. However, a 15%
decrease could make the process unproﬁtable with an ROI of 4.1%. The ﬂuctuation in the
product prices gave maximum and minimum values of ROI in the sensitivity analysis,
which represents the importance of reducing the MIBK losses throughout the process. On
the other hand, raw material prices come in as a second large contributor to the process
proﬁtability, in which a 15% increase in the raw material prices decreases the ROI to
12.7%, whereas a 15% reduction in the raw material prices increases the ROI to 46%. This
highlights how crucial it is to properly recover unreacted raw materials (e.g., acetone
and hydrogen), in addition to the great inﬂuence that the higher selectivity can have on
the process proﬁtability. The ﬁxed capital investment was found to be the third largest
contributor, with an ROI of 23.5% if its cost increased by 15% and an ROI of 37.7% if
its cost decreased by 15%. This also highlights that even though recovering more of the
product and raw materials can increase the TCI, it has a lower negative inﬂuence on the
process proﬁtability than losing them. In addition, it is worth noting that the utility cost,
as expected, has an insigniﬁcant impact on the ROI as the current utility cost is $1.646
million per year, representing only 2.95% of the total product cost, which is due to the
low-pressure requirement in the process compared to the conventional process, which is
directly associated with the electricity consumption.",Yes

270,270,Figure 7. Return on investment under various market variations of the economic factors.,No
271,271,4.7. Effect of Reaction Temperature on the Process Proﬁtability,No
272,272,"The temperature for reactor operation proposed by Al-Rabiah et al. [40,41] is in the
range of (200–350) ◦C. The conducted sensitivity analysis has shown that it is appealing
to increase the conversion and selectivity of the process. In the current study, the used
temperature is 300 ◦C. When the reactor temperature is increased to 350 ◦C, the conver-
sion and selectivity are increased from 66% and 69.4% to 77.3% and 72.2%, respectively.
Consequently, less acetone is required, and more MIBK is produced. Nevertheless, this
also increases the heating requirement needed for the feed stream as well as the reactor
cooling system. In order to determine the optimum temperature in terms of proﬁtability,
the process was simulated at 350 ◦C. All costs were determined in the same manner as
previously done. Figure 8 shows that as the reactor temperature increases, the ﬁxed capital
investment decreases, which is due to the lower volume of the distillation column T-101 that
is needed to separate acetone from the process stream. In addition, the rest of the columns’
size remained almost the same as the production rate was ﬁxed. In addition, the cost of the
compressor decreased because the numbers of unreacted moles of acetone and hydrogen
were lower. On the other hand, the heating utility that is required to maintain the reactor
temperature was increased by about 10%. In addition, more heating utility was required
for E-102 because the minimum temperature approach was increased from 10 ◦C to 30 ◦C
to prevent a phase change prior to the compressor. It is worth noting that even though
the inlet temperature to E-105 was increased from 164 ◦C to 180 ◦C, the heat duty was
about 11% less due to the lower ﬂow rate entering the heat exchanger. The condenser and
reboiler heat loads of T-101 were also lower due to the lower amount of unreacted acetone.
An overall assessment of energy consumption is shown in Figure 8, which indicates that
increasing the temperature from 300 ◦C to 350 ◦C reduces the overall energy consumption
of the process. Furthermore, the ROI increased to 34.3%, and the payback period decreased
to 2 years.",Yes.
