10,10,"Abstract: Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) is a viable solution to valorise the CO2 captured
from industrial plants’ ﬂue gas, thus avoiding emitting it and synthesizing products with high added
value. On the other hand, using CO2 as a reactant in chemical processes is a challenging task, and a
rigorous analysis of the performance is needed to evaluate the real impact of CCU technologies in
terms of efﬁciency and environmental footprint. In this paper, the energetic performance of a DME
and methanol synthesis process fed by 25% of the CO2 captured from a natural gas combined cycle
(NGCC) power plant and by the green hydrogen produced through an electrolyser was evaluated.
The remaining 75% of the CO2 was compressed and stored underground. The process was assessed
by means of an exergetic analysis and compared to post-combustion Carbon Capture and Storage
(CCS), where 100% of the CO2 captured was stored underground. Through the exergy analysis, the
quality degradation of energy was quantiﬁed, and the sources of irreversibility were detected. The
carbon-emitting source was a 189 MW Brayton–Joule power plant, which was mainly responsible
for exergy destruction. The CCU conﬁguration showed a higher exergy efﬁciency than the CCS,
but higher exergy destruction per non-emitted carbon dioxide. In the DME/methanol production
plant, the main contribution to exergy destruction was given by the distillation column separating
the reactor outlet stream and, in particular, the top-stage condenser was found to be the component
with the highest irreversibility (45% of the total). Additionally, the methanol/DME synthesis reactor
destroyed a signiﬁcant amount of exergy (24%). Globally, DME/methanol synthesis from CO2 and
green hydrogen is feasible from an exergetic point of view, with 2.276 MJ of energy gained per 1 MJ
of exergy destroyed.",No.

23,23,"The extensive concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a threat to environ-
mental safety, contributing to the greenhouse effect, but CO2 is a source of carbon for plants
and can also be used as a reactant in chemical reactions [1–3]. This concept has led to the
development of Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technologies, which are perceived
as a more justiﬁed and socially acceptable technology for CO2 management than Carbon
Capture and Storage (CCS). However, even if they can be considered a feasible solution,
their cost is still an issue. Hasan et al. proposed a national Carbon Capture Utilization and
Storage (CCUS) supply chain network for a U.S. case study in their multiscale framework
analysis [4]. With the proposed solution focused on proﬁt rather than maximizing CO2 uti-
lization, average proﬁts between $0.3 and $17.6 per ton of CO2 were achieved (depending
on the weighted average total costs of capturing and utilizing a ton of CO2).",No.
24,24,"There are plenty of ways to apply CCU technology wherever there is a CO2-emitting
source, e.g., energy-intensive industry branches, such as energy, petrochemical and cement
or iron and steel production. Additionally, CCU reactions can be supported with green
technologies, such as renewable energy sources (RES).",Answer: No.
25,25,"The ﬁrst step in a CCU process is the capturing of CO2 through well-known technolo-
gies, such as oxyfuel combustion, pre-combustion or post-combustion, or as a direct-air
capture process [5,6]. Post-combustion carbon capture can be achieved by physical or
chemical separation methods, such as membranes, adsorption, absorption and cryogenic
processes. Many of these technologies are already applied in industry [7]. Pre-combustion
processes capture CO2 prior to the combustion reaction and it can be achieved with the
coal gasiﬁcation process or with oil or gas fuel-reforming processes [8].",Answer: No.
26,26,"After having captured and concentrated the CO2, it can be fed to a chemical reactor for
its conversion into products, such as syngas, urea, methane, ethanol, formic acid, etc. This
paper is focused on the analysis of conﬁgurations to synthesize methanol and dimethyl
ether (DME) from CO2.",Answer: Yes.
27,27,"Dimethyl ether (DME) or methoxymethane is the simplest aliphatic ether with the
molecular formula CH3OCH3. It is a colourless, near-odourless gas under ambient con-
ditions. It is neither a toxic nor carcinogenic compound, with properties similar to liquid
petroleum gas (LPG); thus, it can be easily blended with it and used as a fuel [9–11]. In
the chemical industry, it is mainly used to produce diethyl sulphate, methyl acetate, light
oleﬁns and gasoline [12]. Nowadays, it is considered an alternative fuel with low emis-
sions of NOx, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide [2,13]. DME can be obtained in two

50,50,"In Ref. [16], the authors explored the proﬁtability of DME production from biogas; in
Ref. [17], a techno-economic assessment of bio-DME and bio-methanol production from
oil palm residue was proposed. Methanol is a colourless, ﬂammable liquid under ambient
conditions with a characteristic odour. As one of the most important raw materials, it is
a substrate in many syntheses of chemical compounds, including formaldehyde, acetic
acid and chloromethane. It is also a very good solvent and it is easily miscible with water,
alcohols and organic solvents. Due to its wide application in many industries (fuel, chemical
and other industries), the demand for methanol is constantly growing, i.e., from 47 Mt/a
in 2011 [18] to 100 Mt/a in 2021 [19]. According to the report made by the International
Renewable Energy Agency [19], in 2021, only 0.2% of global production of methanol came

hydrogen is needed [1,5,26,27].",Answer: No.
90,90,"Hydrogen can be synthesized in different ways: chemical, biological, catalytic, electro-
chemical and thermal. To reduce the carbon footprint of the CCU process, a low-emission
hydrogen production technology has to be applied. Among several possible approaches,
the production of “green hydrogen” using an electrolyser powered by a renewable energy
source is the most interesting [28,29].",No

was successfully reduced by 20% compared to the price of methanol produced traditionally.
While there are a number of pilot or demonstration-scale facilities, there are a few
commercial units producing either DME or methanol on an industrial scale. Regarding
existing facilities with a power plant as a carbon dioxide source, two projects developed in
Germany can be taken into consideration.",No
95,95,"The ﬁrst was funded by Europe’s Horizon 2020 program (MefCO2, Project No. 637016).
Nine partners established in 2014 an international cooperation to research the feasibility of
CCU technology along with the production of green methanol. The main aims of the project
were to demonstrate the economic feasibility of utilizing captured CO2 by converting it
into a usable fuel, such as methanol, and further providing green hydrogen produced
from excess energy from renewable sources. The source of carbon dioxide was a lignite-
ﬁred power plant located in Niederaussem, Germany. The project ended in 2019 with the
development of one of the largest facilities in the European Union to synthesize methanol
from CO2 from ﬂue gases, capable of producing 1 ton of methanol per day while capturing
more than 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide per day [30–37].",Yes.
96,96,"Carbon Recycling International Ltd. (CRI, Reykjavik, Iceland), known for producing
renewable methanol since 2007, participated in this project. CRI’s pilot unit is located near
Iceland’s capital—Reykjavik. Industrial-scale green methanol production began in 2012 in
the ﬁrst pilot plant with an annual capacity of about 4000 tonnes of methanol (c.a. 12 t/d).
The process is based on the conversion of CO2 from geothermal sources with the hydrogen
produced by water electrolysis using geothermal energy [1,36,38]. The methanol produced
in this facility is used in a number of applications, including blending with gasoline,
biodiesel production, and wastewater denitriﬁcation. Additionally, the CRI methanol
production process reduces the environmental impact by 90% compared to conventional
methods [19]. Furthermore, CRI, in cooperation with China Henan Shuncheng Group,
developed in 2021 the world’s ﬁrst green methanol plant with a capacity of 110,000 tons
per year [39].",No.
97,97,"The ALIGN-CCUS (Project No 271501) demonstration plant is also located at Nieder-
aussem, Germany. The project was funded through the ERA-NET ACT program and it was
co-funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 program ACT [40]. The
source of the captured CO2 is a 1000 MW power plant unit, and the hydrogen comes from
a 140 kWel alkaline electrolyser providing 22 kg of hydrogen per day. The daily production
of DME is about 50 kg. For DME synthesis, a Mitsubishi Power bifunctional catalyst was
used, which was responsible for both methanol synthesis and the dehydration process [41].
In this paper, we evaluate the energetic performance of a DME and methanol syn-
thesis process fuelled by the CO2 captured from a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC)
power plant and by the green hydrogen produced using an electrolyser (alkaline). The
process conﬁguration performance is assessed by means of an exergetic analysis and com-
pared to a post-combustion CCS. Through exergy, these two different processes can be
evaluated [42–44], assessing the quality degradation of energy and individuating sources
of irreversibility.",No

an implemented temperature approach of equilibrium of 20 K. The distillation columns
used to separate the reaction products were all modelled with the RadFrac column. Every
distillation column had 15 theoretical stages and a Kettle reboiler. Columns C-1 and C-2
were equipped with a partial condenser and their distillate was vaporous, while column
C-3 had a total condenser providing a liquid distillate. DME was the primary product of
the plant, while MeOH was a secondary product. The simulation included seven design

the inlet of the reactor and the distillates’ ﬂow rate and purity at each distillation column.

328,328,"Figures 7 and 8 show the result of the exergy analysis of the DME production plant. The
distillation column C-1 was mainly responsible for the exergy destruction, as it represented
45.19% of all exergy destruction, and its impact on exergy fuel reduction was worth 12.37%.
In particular, the refrigeration cycle at the top stage of C-1 was the operation associated
with the highest irreversibility, as shown in Figure 9. These values were higher than those of
columns C-2 and C-3, because column C-1 dealt with higher ﬂow rates and separated very
different chemical species. Furthermore, as shown in Table 6, much of the stream fed to
column C-1 left the column from the top at a temperature lower than the feed temperature.
This fact determines the high exergy destruction in the column C-1 condenser. The reactor
was the second-most responsible unit for exergy destruction, and column C-3 was the third.
In particular, the exergy destruction associated with column C-3 was due to the difference
in the speciﬁc exergy ξ of the streams. This is shown in Table 6; in fact, the speciﬁc exergy
of the residue ξ22 was lower than the speciﬁc exergy of the feed ξ18 and speciﬁcally of the
distillate ξ21, but the mass ﬂow of the residue was almost ﬁve times the mass ﬂow of the

storage of the recovered carbon dioxide. Focusing on the units treating the recovered CO2,
the destroyed exergy in Route 2 was approximately a tenth of the destroyed exergy in
Route 1 (44.34 MW). Despite the consistent reduction in the destroyed exergy, the DME
production plant unit had higher exergy efﬁciency than the underground storage unit. The
process’ intrinsic exergy efﬁciency was higher, but the additional use of high-value energy
and material streams increased the overall exergy destruction. The exergy efﬁciencies and

The EG value represents the energy consumed per unit of product generated and is an indicator of the process efficiency. A lower EG value indicates a more energy-efficient process. The EG values obtained in this study show that the DME production process has a lower energy consumption compared to the methanol production process.

371,371,5. Conclusions,Answer: No.
372,372,"In the present study, an exergy analysis of a process conﬁguration able to avoid carbon
emissions and to produce DME and methanol is presented. The carbon-emitting source
in this study was a 189 MW power plant. The Brayton–Joule cycle in the power plant
was mainly responsible for exergy destruction, 75% of the produced carbon dioxide was
captured to be stored underground and the remaining 25% was to be transformed into
DME and methanol via reactions with hydrogen. In the plant, the total CO2 generated
by the power cycle was 119,068 kg/h, the amount stored was 89,288 kg/h, the stream
converted was 26,815 kg/h and the amount vented to the atmosphere was 2965 kg/h (2.5%
of the total). The reaction sections converted the CO2 stream into DME (10,381 kg/h) and
methanol (3214.1 kg/h). A second route was considered, i.e., the storage of 100% of the
CO2 generated by the power plant.",No.
373,373,"Of those two routes to avoid carbon emissions, the underground storage offers a much
lower exergy destruction per mass of non-emitted carbon. Inside the DME production plant,
the main contribution to exergy destruction was from the distillation column separating
the reactor outlet stream and, in particular, the top-stage condenser was found to be the
component with the highest irreversibility. This DME synthesis showed a higher efﬁciency
than the underground storage unit, but a higher exergy destruction per non-emitted carbon
dioxide ratio. As a consequence, the process conﬁguration we propose has higher exergetic
efﬁciency and exergy destruction than full geological storage, and produces valuable
compounds, such as DME and methanol. Its feasibility is strictly correlated with the",Answer: No.

hydrogen production at different carbon dioxide shares between DME production and
