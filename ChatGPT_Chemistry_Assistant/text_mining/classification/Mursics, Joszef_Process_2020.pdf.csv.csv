4,4,"Abstract: Waste gases that cannot be released into the environment are generated in chemical
industrial processes. There are various physico-chemical processes for the treatment of these gases,
but in most cases, they present a major cost to the company. There is an EU directive for each
industrial area describing the best available techniques (BAT) and the prescribed environmental limits
for the maximum discharge of dangerous substances into the environment. The current process for
the removal of formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds from waste industrial gases meets
EU environmental regulations. However, expected new EU directives will require a signiﬁcant
reduction in formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds’ concentrations in industrial exhaust
gases, thus necessitating a new technical solution for the removal of formaldehyde. This paper
describes two methods of removing formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds from waste
gases, generated by the metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production processes. The ﬁrst method
involves upgrading existing processes of removing formaldehyde from waste gases with an additional
absorption plant, with which emissions can be signiﬁcantly reduced. The second method describes
the co-incineration of waste gases generated by a metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production
process with natural gas in a gas turbine, where formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds
are completely removed, while electricity is also produced. The second method is also useful for
removing various concentrations of volatile organic compounds from waste gases generated in
chemical industrial processes.",No.

6,6,1. Introduction,No
7,7,"Formalin, an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, is one of the most important base products in the
production of high-volume products in the chemical industry [1]. The amount of international trade of
formaldehyde today is less than 2% of the total volume of formaldehyde produced. The transport costs
for formaldehyde aqueous solutions are very high because of the relatively high proportion of water in
the product. Therefore, formaldehyde is usually used or processed at the site of production [2]. Taking
into consideration the constant increases in energy expenses in the production of such a high volume
of formaldehyde aqueous solutions, an optimal way of increasing eﬃciency is the use of by-product
energy, based on energy released in the process, and on oﬀ-gases from the production of formaldehyde
from methanol [3]. Energy management has become a very important branch of research in the
chemical process industry [4]. New developments include trends toward annual emission coupon
distribution aﬀects, limiting time-related components in decision making, and executing the transition
to processes based upon the latest technologies.",Answer: No.

13,13,"•
•",Answer: No.
14,14,"There are two basic production processes for formaldehyde:
The metal oxide catalyst process, operating with air surplus [5],
The silver catalyst process, operating with methanol surplus [6].
In the following sections, formaldehyde production plants using the two main process technologies
are described. This is the outcome of the development and investment in energetic process optimization,
including side streams of chemicals and energy, in various formaldehyde production plants over the
course of several years.",Answer: Yes.

17,17,2.1. Formaldehyde Production Using Metal Oxide Catalyst Processes,No
18,18,"During production with a metal oxide catalyst (molybdenum and iron oxide), formaldehyde is
formed by partial oxidation of methanol with oxygen [5]. The reactions take place on a metal oxide
catalyst in a reactor operating at a temperature of 250 to 500
C with a static layer of catalyst for

20,20,CH3OH + 1/2 O2 → CH2O + H2O dH = −159 kJ/mol,Answer: No.
21,21,(1),Answer: No.
22,22,"To maintain the necessary oxidation atmosphere, the required ratio between methanol and air is
low; the methanol content is approximately 4 to 10 vol.%. This high surplus of air is possible because a
portion of the gas from the absorber is recycled, resulting in a suﬃcient reduction of oxygen to avoid
the formation of explosive mixtures. The overall process yield of formaldehyde from methanol is
90–92 mol percent. The thermal energy released during the reaction is discharged from the reactor
using thermal oil as a liquid medium for the energy transfer; the oil is then used for the production
of steam.",No.
23,23,2.2. Formaldehyde Production Using Silver Catalyst Processes,Answer: Yes.
24,24,"The ﬁrst industrial formaldehyde production processes used silver as catalyst [7]. This process
burdens the environment with gas emissions into the air, and with the generation of excess steam
condensate containing up to 0.2% of formaldehyde, which cannot be recycled into the process.",No
25,25,"The silver catalyst process partially converts methanol to formaldehyde with eﬃciency of up to
90%. The ternary mixture of formaldehyde/water/methanol must be separated via steam distillation.
Afterwards, the steam condensate is contaminated with formaldehyde (up to 0.2%), creating extra
costs for disposal or further treatment.",No
26,26,The synthesis is carried out using catalytic oxidation and dehydration of methanol in contact with,"a catalyst. The reaction takes place in a fixed-bed reactor, where the methanol and air react to produce formaldehyde and water. The reaction is highly exothermic and requires careful temperature control. The formaldehyde is then separated from the reaction mixture using distillation. The off-gas from the distillation column is recycled back to the reactor to maximize the conversion of methanol. Finally, the formaldehyde is further processed to produce various downstream products, such as resins or plastics.

for steam production. Steam, which can be used in other processes or used for electricity production,
is generated in the puriﬁcation of the waste gases. The average production is approximately 21.6 t/hr
formaldehyde with 37% concentration. Table 1 shows the composition of waste oﬀ-gases (A) before
the puriﬁcation process and (B) after catalytic puriﬁcation of waste gases. The data in Table 1 were

223,223,"The waste gas treatment process described in Figure 1 is in accordance with existing EU directives

water absorption, as shown in Figure 4, formaldehyde emission is reduced from 0.033 kg/h to about
0.0056 kg/h; about 0.027 kg/h formaldehyde is absorbed in water, which is then used as process water.
In order to completely remove formaldehyde from waste gases, which contain other combustible
organic substances, co-incineration with natural gas is recommended, with the resulting energy used
to generate electricity. Proposed new technological process for oﬀ-gases’ co-incineration from the
metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production processes reduces the levels of formaldehyde, carbon

(Figure 2). In the computer simulation, the equilibrium absorption constants and reactions of low
concentrations of formaldehyde in water were taken into account.",No
391,391,"By describing an additional new process for absorbing low concentrations of formaldehyde from
waste gases (Figure 2) and comparing the data obtained with the measurements of the real production
process (Figure 1) given in Table 1 and the results of computer simulation given in [12], formaldehyde
emissions into the environment can be reduced by more than ﬁve times. The heat generated by the
process of removing formaldehyde and VOCs from waste gases produced by metal oxide catalyst
formaldehyde production processes (Figures 1 and 2) can be used to produce steam used for the
production process or to generate electricity.",No
392,392,"The second proposed technical solution in the conducted study is the co-combustion of waste
gases produced by metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production processes with CCGT (Figure 5) or
CHP if the steam produced is used for heat production instead of electricity production. The results of a
computer simulation of co-incineration of waste gases generated by metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde
production processes with CCGT or CHP are given in Table 4, which shows that the concentration of
formaldehyde and VOCs in the waste gases decreased to practically zero.",No.
393,393,"In the performed research of the removal of formaldehyde and VOCs by co-incineration of waste
gases produced by metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production processes with CCGT or CHP power
plants, we removed formaldehyde and VOCs from the waste gas and saved the cost of electricity or heat
required to operate the production process, which is in line with the expected new EU environmental
directives, sustainable development, and the company’s global competitiveness.",No
